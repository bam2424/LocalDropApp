## ✅ COMPLETED: Phase 1 - Full UI Implementation

**What's Been Built:**
- ✅ Complete modern MAUI application with MVVM architecture
- ✅ Beautiful file drop interface with cards and shadows
- ✅ Peer discovery section with real-time status indicators
- ✅ File selection with drag-drop area and file management
- ✅ Transfer progress with real-time progress bars and status
- ✅ Transfer history and active transfer monitoring
- ✅ Mock data for UI development and testing
- ✅ Professional color scheme and modern design
- ✅ Cross-platform responsive layout

**Ready for Demo:**
The application is now ready to be run and demoed! All UI components are functional with mock data. You can see peer discovery, file selection, transfer progress, and history management in action.

**To Run:**
- Open in Visual Studio 2022
- Set to Windows Machine profile
- Build and run (F5)

## Notes
- Phase 1 COMPLETE! ✅ Beautiful, functional UI ready for backend integration
- Next: Phase 2 will add real networking (UDP discovery + TCP file transfer)
- Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
- Test UI components individually before integration
- Focus on core MVP functionality before advanced features
- Prioritize cross-platform compatibility from the start
